# Contact-Us
I will create a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for a contact form with input validation featuring like :-
1. Input fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message.
2. Validation rules:
3. Name: required, minimum 2 characters.
4. Email: required, valid email format.
5. Subject: optional but max 100 characters.
6. Message: required, minimum 10 characters.
7. Display error messages inline under each field.
8. Disable submit button if the form is invalid.
9. Show success message on successful submission (simulated; no backend).
10. Modern, clean, responsive design with clear feedback.
